* This project was bootstrapped with Create React App

* React doesn't prescribe a specific approach to data fetching, but people use either a library like axios or the fetch() API provided by the browser, in this branch I add a fetch for todo data to the [base app](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/tree/base-app)

* [docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v1.1.5/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#fetching-data-with-ajax-requests) on how to do this from create react app

* checkout the diff [here](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/pull/15/files) for all the changes in this branch
