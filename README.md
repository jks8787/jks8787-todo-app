### Objective:
[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that is intended to make it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

* Add and configure [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) and rewrite the generated test that came with create-react-app inside the [base app](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/tree/base-app)

### Documentation:
Documentation for installation can be found [here](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/react-16.html), and documentation for how to use it with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) can be found [here](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jest.html).

### Code:
To see all the changes for this branch checkout out the diff from the base app [here](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/pull/13/files).
