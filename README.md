* in this branch I am integrating a CSS preprocessor ( SCSS specifically ) to the [base app](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/tree/base-app)

* [docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v1.1.5/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc) on how to do this for a create react app project (version `1.5.2`)
