### Objective:
React doesn't prescribe a specific approach to data fetching, but people use either a library like axios or the fetch() API provided by the browser.

* Add a fetch for todo data to the [base app](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/tree/base-app).

### Documentation:
Documentation for how to do this in create react app can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v1.1.5/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#fetching-data-with-ajax-requests).

### Code:
To see all the changes for this branch checkout out the diff from the base app [here](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/pull/15/files).
