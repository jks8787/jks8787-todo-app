* This project was bootstrapped with Create React App

* Create React App doesn't prescribe a specific routing solution, but react-router is the most popular one, in this branch I add the the router to the [base app](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/tree/base-app)

* [docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v1.1.5/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-router) on how to do this for a create react app project (version `1.5.2`)

* check out the diff [here](https://github.com/jks8787/jks8787-todo-app/pull/16/files) to see all the changes for this branch
